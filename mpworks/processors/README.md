# Processors package

This package is used in managing the MPEnv strategy of runs - e.g., insert things into the submissions database, move those to workflows, back-update the submissions with information on the runs, etc...

It also contains a "canonical" set of test runs for testing changes to MPWorks/MPEnv/etc.
